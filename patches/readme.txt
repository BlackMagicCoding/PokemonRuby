Patches created throughout my Glitch Fixing series, where I want to get rid of the Gen3 glitches left in the game.
Focussing on Ruby & Sapphire for now... might consider Emerald too if I feel like it.

Patches are sorted in folders with their episode number, and they contain IPS patches, which are split by ROM:
<episode_number>_R_* for Ruby
<episode_number>_S_* for Sapphire

ROM Bases used were:
AXVE - CRC32:61641576 - Pokemon - Ruby Version (Europe) (Rev 1)
AXPE - CRC32:BAFEDAE5 - Pokemon - Sapphire Version (Europe) (Rev 1)
